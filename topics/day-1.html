<h2 id="Activity-Instructions">Activity Instructions</h2>
<p>Students will be asked to assume the role of a landscape contractor as they try to find appropriate villa construction sites across a mountainous territory. The main objective of this task is to place the villa in the highest location—on the Tangible Landscape model—from which water can naturally drain into the treatment ponds. Students must consider the following criteria when completing the activity: (1) the villas should be placed on the highest location possible (to benefit from the scenic overviews); and (2) the water runoff from the villa’s roof should be directed to the designated treatment ponds located in the foothills. 
</p>
<p>To begin the activity, students will first be shown a blue circle indicating the location of the treatment pond the water must be directed to. Students will then use wooden markers to place each villa onto the Tangible Landscape physical model. If the villa is placed strategically, the runoff will flow into the pond (i.e., blue circle) as determined by the landscape’s natural shape and topography. As soon as students place the wooden marker, a blue line will then be presented onto the model—indicating the water flow path—so students can learn whether the water drains into the designated pond or not. If students are not satisfied with their villa placement (i.e., the water does not correctly drain into the designated pond), they may make multiple attempts until they are satisfied. Once students are satisfied with the villas’ location, they must then push a yellow button to see the correct answer—indicated as a green circle—and to continue placing the remaining villas (7 total). Students must build as many villas as they can in 10 minutes.
